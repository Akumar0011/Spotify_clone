Technologies Used:

1. HTML/CSS
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The backbone structure of your webpage. It defines the layout, including elements like the sidebar, main content area, and music player.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the HTML elements. In your case, CSS is responsible for the dark theme, responsive design, layout structure, and visual aesthetics like font choice, colors, and spacing.
2. Responsive Design
Media Queries: The code includes a media query for screens with a width less than 1000px, hiding certain elements to make the layout responsive. This ensures the webpage looks good on both large and small screens.
3. Flexbox
Flexbox: A CSS layout model that helps distribute space and align items within containers. It's used in your code to align the sidebar, main content, music player, and various other components.
4. Positioning
Fixed Positioning: Used for the music player to keep it fixed at the bottom of the screen, ensuring it's always visible as the user scrolls.
Sticky Positioning: Applied to the navigation bar (sticky-nav), making it stay at the top when the user scrolls down, enhancing usability.
5. Customization
Custom Styles: The CSS includes custom styles for various elements, such as the .card, .box, and .progress-bar, to create a unique look and feel tailored to your specific design requirements.
6. Pseudo-Classes
Hover Effects: The code uses the :hover pseudo-class to create interactive elements, like changing the opacity when a user hovers over a navigation option or a control icon, enhancing the user experience.
